# Standard Cortical Observer - Web API Client

The SCO Client is a Python library to interact with an existing Standard Cortical
Observer Web API. It provides methods to access resources managed by a SCO Web
API on a local computer.

File (e.g., anatomy MRI data or image groups) may be accessed directly from the
API or cached locally to improve performance.
